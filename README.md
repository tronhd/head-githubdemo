### Things About Me That will Change 
1. I am taking a coding class. *"Thanks for the information dad"*
2. Trying to learn French. *"I'd be doing better if I stopped be lazy."* :disappointed:
3. My current favorite song is _*Karma by AJR*_. *"The ending of that song hits the right note for me"*
    >To give me some diagnosis of why I'm so hollow
Please give me instructions, I promise I'll follow
I tripped on my ankle and fractured my elbow
But doesn't that mean that the tour's gonna sell though?
I try to explain the good faith that's been wasted
But after an hour it sounds like complaining
Wait don't go away, can I lie here forever?
You say that I'm better, why don't I feel better?
The universe works in mysterious ways
But I'm starting to think it ain't working for me
Doctor, should I be good?
Should I be good this year? -Karma by AJR :+1:
